**Members - Only**

In these projects, we‚Äôll be working to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.
We will build an application that allows users to create posts and the authors of the posts are displayed only if as a User you are logged in.


>Project was created using Ruby on Rails. Users can post in the blog which was implemented. Additionally, Authorized users are able to modify the posts but posts can read anybody but he doesn't know about authors of the post.  

>Devise was used authentication and authorization users securely.
